# Bankease
The Main class is the entry point of BankEase, showing menus for registration, login, and exit. Logged-in users can create accounts, deposit, withdraw, or logout. It uses BankServices for operations, Scanner for input, and modern switch syntax for clarity, ensuring secure access and easy code maintenance.
